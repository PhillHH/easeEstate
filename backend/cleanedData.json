  "messageContent": "\r\nAtlassian\r\n  \r\nHow do permissions all fit together?\r\n \r\nLet's break it down.\r\n\r\n👋 Hey Phillip Rugullis,\r\n \r\nConfluence is designed to be open and collaborative, so all content is viewable to all users by default. Every organization has different needs, and you can customize view and access permissions so that they're just right for you. Don't want everyone seeing your drafts and work in progress? Have confidential content? Make your site, spaces, and pages as open or closed as you want to.\r\n \r\nThe next four emails will give you an overview on the Confluence permissions model and how it all fits together. \r\n \r\nThere are three levels of permissions in Confluence:\r\n \r\n \r\n1. Global permissions\r\n>> https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/manage-global-permissions/?utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nGlobal (site-wide) permissions are assigned and managed by the site admins.\r\n \r\n* Use global permissions to see which users and groups currently have access to your Confluence site and make high-level decisions about what they can do on it.\r\n \r\n* View changes to global permissions via the audit log.\r\n>> https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/view-the-audit-log/?utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n\r\n \r\n2. Space permissions\r\n>> https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/what-are-space-permissions/?utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nEach space has its own set of permissions that are set and managed by the space admin(s). The user who creates a space automatically becomes the admin of that space, but they can add other admins later.\r\n \r\n* Assign or revoke permissions to view, add, edit, and delete content within a space, and apply that to groups and individual users.\r\n>> https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/assign-space-permissions/?utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\n* Manage watchers for that space – watchers are notified about updates to pages and blog posts including content changes, in-line comments, reactions, and end of page comments.\r\n \r\nPro tip: If you're on a Premium plan, you can copy permissions from one space to another.\r\n \r\n \r\n3. Page permissions\r\n>> https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/add-or-remove-page-restrictions/?utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nPage creators manage who can view and/or edit individual pages in a space.\r\n \r\n* If you set restrictions to your page, it will only be accessible by those who have permission to view it. It won't appear in search results or in the page tree for anyone else.\r\n \r\nNote: View restrictions are inherited, which means a restriction applied to one page will cascade down to any child pages. This is the same concept as password protecting a folder on your desktop – anything you add inside it will also be protected by that password.\r\n \r\n– Atlassian Customer Success\r\n \r\n---------------------------------------\r\n \r\nRead in browser - https://view.e.atlassian.com/?qs=4b8e3f056f8a42baf6efc8833382a2af1b4cc868dcce34ba7ea55b35651e259e9c84eb16a9321becd46979688daf6831b51aa33dd7c9fb430975468d780552aced4858f4b47d47f2\r\n \r\nPrivacy Policy - https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy??utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nContact us - http://www.atlassian.com/company/contact??utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nRead our Blog - http://blogs.atlassian.com/??utm_source=cs-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=P%3Aconfluence%2AO%3Acs%2AC%3Asac%2AW%3A1%2AI%3Apermissions_eml-12522%2AE%3Acloud%2A_EML-12522&jobid=107109083&subid=1957965425&send_date=5/19/2025\r\n \r\nFollow on Twitter - http://twitter.com/Atlassian\r\n \r\nCopyright 2025 Atlassian Pty Ltd.
